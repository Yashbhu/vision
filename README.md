✅ 1. WHAT TO DESCRIBE – USE OF FALCON IN CONTINUOUS LEARNING

This is a "real-world robustness + adaptability" question. They’re testing:

Will your model get outdated over time?

Can your pipeline retrain or adapt without manual intervention?


🔥 Explanation to put in your report:

> We plan to integrate Falcon (LLM) as a continual learning controller to monitor model confidence levels and feedback loops.



Breakdown:

Falcon sits in the backend pipeline.

When the model misclassifies, confidence is low, or a new object appears, Falcon:

Logs these incidents

Generates a natural language description of what went wrong

Suggests label correction or adds it to a "to-review" dataset



🔁 Retraining Loop:

New edge-case data is saved.

Once a threshold of unknown or misclassified samples is reached, Falcon:

1. Triggers a retraining job (Fine-tuning pipeline) — either scheduled or on-demand.


2. Annotates data with meta descriptions ("This object looks similar to Class A but has X difference").




🧠 Adaptive Learning with Human in Loop:

Falcon optionally generates suggestions for the user ("Do you want to label this as X?").

You can even create a feedback tab in the app that sends missed predictions to backend retraining.

💻 2. WHAT TO IMPLEMENT – THE MINIMUM WORKING DEMO (FOR HACKATHON)

🏗️ System Architecture (Your App):

Frontend (React Native / Web):

Capture / Upload Image

Send to backend (POST /predict)

Show predictions

Optional: "Not accurate?" button that sends image + feedback


Backend (Flask or FastAPI):

/predict – serves YOLOv8 model inference

/feedback – collects incorrect or unknown predictions


Falcon Integration:

POST /review – uses Falcon to:

Suggest likely mislabel

Log confusion cases

Store in retrain_queue/



Retraining trigger (can be simulated in hackathon):

Manual trigger or CRON (every 24 hrs or 10 samples)

Reloads model weights

Logs version: v1.2, v1.3 etc.

🎯 Real-world Scenario to Include in Presentation

> "Let’s say we trained the model on red fire extinguishers. A new white one is introduced in the building. Our current model misclassifies it as a plastic bottle. Falcon detects repeated low confidence scores for this object, flags it, creates a metadata description, and adds it to the retraining set. Within 24 hours, our model learns the new object with zero manual code changes."

🧠 Extra Ideas to Flex:

1. Model Versioning — show that you're tracking model_v1.pt, model_v2.pt, etc.


2. Live Performance Graph — use chart to show detection accuracy change over time.


3. On-device Model Hot Swap — new model is pulled on app restart.


4. Offline feedback collection — store images locally and sync when connected.


5. Explainability with Falcon — on prediction, Falcon explains why it classified something.
