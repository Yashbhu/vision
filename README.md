## ✅ Falcon-Integrated Continuous Learning

### 🔍 Problem
In dynamic environments, static models degrade over time.

### ⚡ Solution
Falcon LLM monitors model outputs, identifies confusion, and initiates retraining—**without manual dev intervention**.

## 🧠 Falcon's Role in Learning Loop

Falcon operates in the backend as an **intelligent observer + retraining trigger**.

**Triggers Falcon When:**
- 🔻 Low model confidence  
- ❌ Misclassification detected  
- 🆕 New or unseen object appears  

**Falcon Does:**
- Logs edge cases and mispredictions  
- Generates a natural language description of what went wrong  
- Suggests label correction or flags it as `to-review`  

---

## 🔁 Automated Retraining Loop

Once N confusing or misclassified samples collected:

1. Falcon **kicks off fine-tuning**  
2. Adds semantic tags like:  
   > “Object resembles Class A but has a texture similar to Class B”  
3. Retraining pipeline:  
   - Re-train YOLOv8  
   - Save model as `model_v2.pt`, `model_v3.pt`, etc.  
   - Serve new weights  

> 🔄 Can be triggered via CRON job or on-demand API  

---

## 🧠 Human-in-the-Loop Feedback (Optional)

- Falcon asks: _“Do you want to label this as [Class]?”_  
- User confirms/corrects  
- Sample pushed to retraining queue  

App has:
- 🔘 "Not accurate?" feedback button  
- Sends image + correction to Falcon backend

## 🏗️ System Architecture

**🖥️ Frontend (React Native / Web):**  
- Upload / capture image  
- `POST /predict` → backend  
- Display prediction + confidence  
- [ ] Optional: feedback button → `/feedback`  

**🔙 Backend (Flask):**  
- `/predict`: YOLOv8 inference  
- `/feedback`: stores incorrect/unknown predictions  
- `/review`: Falcon logs confusion, suggests label, queues data

## 🎯 Real-World Scenario for Judges

> 🔥 Trained model detects red fire extinguishers. A new **white** extinguisher appears.  
> Model misclassifies it as a **plastic bottle**.  
> Falcon detects repeated low confidence scores, generates meta-descriptions, flags it for retraining.  
> Within 24 hours — model learns it. No dev intervention. 💥
